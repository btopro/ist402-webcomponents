# play-ground

This is a play ground for our IST 402 course. The goals of this playground are to do the following:

- See the raw power of whats coming with the web
- Play with web components and learn more about them
- Get the concepts of what stackblitz is providing that would make it beneficial to teams
- Better understand package managers by leveraging one (just without all the "tooling")

[Edit on StackBlitz ⚡️](https://stackblitz.com/edit/ist402-webcomponents)

## Lesson plan
- talk about the differences between these tags and how they work cascading, why they behave differently
- get a new tag
